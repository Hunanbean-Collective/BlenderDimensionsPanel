# BlenderDimensionsPanel

Adds a Dimensions panel to the Object Properties.

This is a small plugin to add a Dimensions Panel to the Object Properties pane in Blender.

It seems that due to the way Blender handles things, it could not be added directly to the Transform panel from a plugin, but had to be its own. (this may be fixable by someone who knows more than me)

Minor annoyance that should not cause too many issues, since Panels can now be re-ordered
